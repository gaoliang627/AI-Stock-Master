## Core Algorithm Details

### 1. RTSI - Individual Stock Trend Strength Index

**Algorithm Theoretical Foundation**

The RTSI algorithm is built on modern portfolio theory and behavioral finance principles, combined with machine learning technology. The algorithm quantifies individual stock trend strength through multi-dimensional data fusion.

**Mathematical Model**
```
RTSI = α₁ × TrendSlope + α₂ × Consistency + α₃ × Confidence + α₄ × Volume_Factor

Where:
TrendSlope = Σ(Pᵢ - Pᵢ₋₁) / n × Normalization Factor
Consistency = 1 - σ(returns) / μ(returns)
Confidence = R² × (1 - p_value)
Volume_Factor = log(Volume_ratio) × Weight
```

**Parameter Description**
- α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄: Weight coefficients optimized through machine learning
- TrendSlope: Trend slope measuring price change direction and intensity
- Consistency: Data consistency evaluating trend stability
- Confidence: Confidence level based on statistical significance testing
- Volume_Factor: Volume factor considering market participation

**Real Case Example**
```
Stock: Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Time Period: January-March 2024
Data:
- Price Change: +15.2%
- Trend Slope: 0.85
- Data Consistency: 0.78
- Confidence: 0.92
- Volume Ratio: 1.35

Calculation Process:
RTSI = 0.4×0.85 + 0.3×0.78 + 0.2×0.92 + 0.1×1.35
RTSI = 0.34 + 0.234 + 0.184 + 0.135 = 0.893

Result: RTSI = 89.3 (Strong Uptrend)
Recommendation: Suitable for buying, suggested stop-loss at 8%
```

**Application Scenarios**
- Short-term trading: Identifying short-term buy/sell opportunities
- Trend judgment: Confirming long-term trend direction
- Risk management: Setting dynamic stop-loss levels
- Portfolio construction: Screening strong stocks

### 2. IRSI - Industry Relative Strength Index

**Algorithm Theoretical Foundation**

The IRSI algorithm is based on factor models in modern portfolio theory, identifying industry rotation opportunities through comparative analysis. The algorithm integrates macroeconomic theory and behavioral finance principles.

**Mathematical Model**
```
IRSI = β₁ × Relative_Return + β₂ × Momentum + β₃ × Volatility_Adj + β₄ × Macro_Factor

Where:
Relative_Return = (Industry_Return - Market_Return) / Market_Volatility
Momentum = Σ(wᵢ × Returnᵢ) for i=1 to n periods
Volatility_Adj = 1 / (1 + Industry_Volatility / Market_Volatility)
Macro_Factor = Economic Cycle Indicator × Policy Impact Factor
```

**Real Case Example**
```
Industry Comparison Analysis (Q1 2024):

New Energy Industry:
- Relative Return: +8.5%
- Momentum Factor: 0.75
- Volatility Adjustment: 0.82
- Macro Factor: 1.15 (Policy Support)
IRSI = 0.3×8.5 + 0.25×0.75 + 0.25×0.82 + 0.2×1.15 = 3.36

Traditional Energy Industry:
- Relative Return: -3.2%
- Momentum Factor: 0.35
- Volatility Adjustment: 0.68
- Macro Factor: 0.85 (Policy Restrictions)
IRSI = 0.3×(-3.2) + 0.25×0.35 + 0.25×0.68 + 0.2×0.85 = -0.45

Conclusion: New energy industry shows relative strength, recommend overweight

- Risk diversification: Industry risk management

### 3. MSCI - Market Sentiment Composite Index

**Algorithm Theoretical Foundation**

The MSCI algorithm is based on behavioral finance theory, combined with market microstructure theory and sentiment analysis technology. It quantifies overall market sentiment through multi-dimensional sentiment indicator fusion.

**Mathematical Model**
```
MSCI = γ₁×Sentiment + γ₂×Flow + γ₃×Volatility + γ₄×Position + γ₅×News_Sentiment

Where:
Sentiment = VIX Fear Index Normalized Value
Flow = Capital Flow Indicator = (Inflow - Outflow) / Total Trading Volume
Volatility = Volatility Indicator = σ(returns) / Historical Average Volatility
Position = Long/Short Ratio = Long_Interest / (Long_Interest + Short_Interest)
News_Sentiment = News Sentiment Analysis Score (Based on NLP Technology)
```

**AI-Enhanced Sentiment Analysis**

The system uses large language models for news sentiment analysis:

```python
# News sentiment analysis workflow
def analyze_market_sentiment(news_data):
    # 1. Text preprocessing
    processed_text = preprocess_news(news_data)
    
    # 2. LLM sentiment analysis
    sentiment_scores = llm_model.analyze_sentiment(processed_text)
    
    # 3. Weight calculation
    weighted_sentiment = calculate_weighted_sentiment(sentiment_scores)
    
    # 4. Time decay
    time_weighted_sentiment = apply_time_decay(weighted_sentiment)
    
    return time_weighted_sentiment
```

**Real Case Example**
```
Market Sentiment Analysis (March 2024):

Input Data:
- VIX Index: 18.5 (Normalized: 0.65)
- Capital Flow: +2.3% (Net Inflow)
- Volatility Ratio: 1.15
- Long/Short Ratio: 0.68
- News Sentiment: 0.72 (Positive Bias)

Calculation Process:
MSCI = 0.25×0.65 + 0.2×2.3 + 0.2×1.15 + 0.15×0.68 + 0.2×0.72
MSCI = 0.1625 + 0.46 + 0.23 + 0.102 + 0.144 = 1.0985

Result: MSCI = 1.10 (Moderately Optimistic)
Recommendation: Moderately increase risk asset allocation, watch for pullback risks
```
